# Gemini-Powered Flask Chatbot with Persistent History

This project is a secure, authenticated web application built with **Flask** that provides a rich chat interface powered by the **Google Gemini API**. It uses **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for stateless authentication, and stores chat history persistently in a local **`history.json`** file.

## üöÄ Features

* **Authentication:** User login secured with **JWT**. The default admin user is created on startup.
* **Gemini AI Integration:** Chat functionality is powered by the `google-genai` SDK and the **`gemini-2.5-flash`** model.
* **Persistent Chat History:** Conversations are saved locally to a **`history.json`** file, indexed by user.
* **Dynamic UI:** Features a modern, split-screen interface with a list of past sessions in a **resizable sidebar** (left menu).
* **Security:** Enforces HTTPS with an ad-hoc SSL context for local development and includes essential security headers.
* **Database:** Uses **SQLite** via Flask-SQLAlchemy for user management.
* **Environment Variables:** Configuration and secrets are managed via the `.env` file.
